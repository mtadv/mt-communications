      description: `
  2B, one of Egypt’s leading retail chains for electronics and home appliances, approached MT for Communications to develop their Black Friday campaign, centered around the concept “the more you buy, the more you save.”
  We crafted and executed a full 360° campaign covering social media, digital OOH, video production, photoshoots, social media design, and in-store branding. The creative idea transformed common “bad buying habits” into positive motivations, showing how 2B’s irresistible offers make every purchase worthwhile.
  
  The campaign featured four unique customer personas:
  * The Greedy Buyer — whose love for more finally pays off.
  * The Shopaholic — who can indulge freely as spending more now means saving more.
  * The Gamer — who keeps winning with every additional purchase.
  * The Lucky One — who always seems to get extra offers thanks to her luck.
  
  Through these relatable profiles and an engaging creative execution, MT for Communications helped 2B deliver a memorable and energetic Black Friday campaign that boosted brand engagement.
